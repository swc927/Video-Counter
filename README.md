# Glow Tally by SWC

Interactive counters over any video. Add multiple counters, set time and value keyframes, and numbers will flow smoothly between those points while the video plays.

## Quick start
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Upload a video.
3. Create a counter and place it.
4. Add keyframes for time and value.
5. Press Play.


## New in this build
1. Click a counter to select. Press Delete or Backspace to remove. You can also click the Ã— button that appears on hover.
2. Counters now stay hidden before their first keyframe time and only start animating from that point.
3. Value display maps precisely to the time between keyframes without pre-rolling.
