# Glow Tally by SWC

Interactive counters over any video. Add multiple counters, set time and value keyframes, and numbers will flow smoothly between those points while the video plays.

## Quick start
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Upload a video.
3. Create a counter and place it.
4. Add keyframes for time and value.
5. Press Play.

## New in this build
1. Delete is easier. Select a counter and press Delete or Backspace. Click the close button that appears on hover. Or use the Delete selected button in the header. Use Clear all to remove everything.
2. Video export. Press Export video to render the video together with your counters into a WebM clip. Press Stop export to finish early.
3. Fixes for the keyboard handler and other small logic issues so deletion is reliable.

## Notes
- Export creates a WebM file for broad browser support. If you need MP4 you can convert the WebM using a desktop tool or ffmpeg.
